        "description": "A gorgeous performance of Chopin's four impromptus. Kissin's playing is warm and free (as befits the form), featuring generous rubato and a striking fondness for the \"Russian Crescendo\" -- that is to say, emphasising a passage marked with a crescendo by doing the exact opposite and playing with a decrescendo (you'll hear this usually used in the Rachmaninoff piano concerti). Kissin's playing never becomes cavalier, however -- the tempi are always moderate-to-slow, the voicing archly refined, and the melodic shape perfectly formed. It's very hard to find this mixture of freedom and ruminative intensity in a performance.\n\nChopin's impromptus all have a similar form: A B A + coda, with outer sections dominated by a sustained, heightened motion with a meandering melody stretched across very broad arches, whilst the middle section usually features a lyrical song in much slower motion. This is the reverse of the pattern found in Chopin's nocturnes, and it's actually perfectly plausible to see these pieces as inside-out nocturnes, as masterfully crafted as anything Chopin wrote.\n\n00:00 -- No.1 in A-flat Major. Light as foam and bright in colour, with two etudal outer sections framing a harmonically playful if sombre nocturne.\n04:34 -- No.2 in F-sharp Major. The most complex impromptu, featuring an uncannily capricious narrative structure. It begins with a surprising choral pasage that transitions via pearly chords into a sweeping heroic passage. This passage ends via one of the most bizarre and striking moduations Chopin ever produced [7:37], and then the main choral theme is subjected to some richly textured variations.\n10:42 -- No.3 in G-flat Major. A shining example of how Chopin could elevate even the most humble forms. Beautiful melodic lines in the outer sections, and an utterly inspired, perfectly crafted episode of polyrhythmic counterpoint for the middle section that somehow manages to sound completely free.\n17:45 -- No.4 in C-sharp Minor. Actually the first impromptu to be written, and published against Chopin's express wishes after his death (with a unnecessary \"fantaisie-\" added to its title). Note how liberally this impromptu borrows from the Moonlight Sonata's 3rd movement -- the downward run at 17:57 is taken right out of the Moonlight's cadenza, for instance, and the textures at the end of this impromptu are also very similar to that of the Moonlight.",

        "description": "And here\u2019s the biggest one of them all. The weird, titanic, gnarled, joyous, grief-stricken monster that is the Hammerklavier. Where exactly to begin? \n\nWith the interval of a 3rd, I guess. It permeates the work at every level, creating close coordination between motivic/harmonic detail, and tonal structure. The main theme of each movement is built from the same motif: a rising and then falling 3rd. In the final movement the 3rd both defies the movement in the bass in the introduction, as well as the shape of the fugue theme: a rising 3rd (10th), following by a scalar figure that is repeated, each time descending by a 3rd. Harmonically, the development section of the third movement is built on a sequence of 3rds, and the trio of the scherzo oscillates between Bb Minor and Db Major, two keys separated by a 3rd.\n\nAt an even deeper structural level, the 3rd is all-pervasive. You\u2019d expect, in a Bb Maj sonata, that the dominant key of F would play a major role, but in 40+ minutes of music there is not a single modulation to that key. Instead, Beethoven constructs an intricate system of four keys around Bb, and returns to them time and time again. Three of them, G, D, and F#, are all separated from Bb by the interval of a third. The final, the \u201cblack key\u201d of B Minor, occurs in every movement and functions as an anti-thesis to Bb Major. The struggle between these two keys dramatically frames the entire sonata (just listen to the scherzo\u2019s ending).\n\nThere\u2019s lots more to the Hammerklavier than the 3rd. You\u2019ve got structural innovations: in the 1st movement\u2019s recapitulation the return to the stable tonic is heavily delayed (by, yes, the key of B minor), and in the 2nd the development is too short, but the recapitulation varies and decorates the theme so extensively that it becomes a sort of extended development. And you\u2019ve got the sheer contrapuntal and dramatic genius of the last movement, where a huge number of traditional contrapuntal devices are wielded with a jaggedness and fury that belies their conservative associations. It's also worth noting how contrapuntal the writing in the 1st movement is -- one of the most striking features of Beethoven's late work.\n\nMVT 1\nEXPOSITION\n00:00 \u2013 Theme 1 \n00:43 \u2013 Shift to D (modulating by 3rd), beginning of Theme group 2.\n01:51 \u2013 Theme 2 (G Maj; modulating by 3rd)\nDEVELOPMENT\n04:44 \u2013 Theme 2\n04:58 \u2013 Theme 1 head\n05:06 \u2013 Fughetta based on Theme 1 head\n06:09 \u2013 Shift from D to B Maj (modulation by 3rd; note closeness to \u201cblack key\u201d)\nRECAPITULATION\n06:37 \u2013 Theme 1\n06:48 \u2013 Shift to Gb/F#.

Eventually a F pedal emerges.\n40:38 \u2013 Theme 1\u2019s head is repeated, then its middle.\n40:58 \u2013 The leap and trill which opened the fugue subject closes the sonata.",

Among his best-known works are the orchestral compositions Rhapsody in Blue (1924) and An American in Paris (1928) as well as the opera Porgy and Bess (1935).\n\nGershwin studied piano under Charles Hambitzer and composition with Rubin Goldmark and Henry Cowell. He began his career as a song plugger, but soon started composing Broadway theatre works with his brother Ira Gershwin and Buddy DeSylva. He moved to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger, where he began to compose An American in Paris. After returning to New York City, he wrote Porgy and Bess with Ira and the author DuBose Heyward. Initially a commercial failure, Porgy and Bess is now considered one of the most important American operas of the twentieth century.\n\nGershwin's compositions have been adapted for use in many films and for television, and several became jazz standards recorded in many variations. Many celebrated singers and musicians have covered his songs. Gershwin moved to Hollywood and composed numerous film scores until his untimely death in 1937 from a brain tumor.\n\n0:00 Cuban Overture\n11:20 Piano Concerto In F - Andante Con Moto, Adagio\n22:34 Porgy & Bess\n36:09 3 Preludes For Piano - Prelude #1\n37:36 3 Preludes For Piano - Preludes #2\n41:48 3 Preludes For Piano - Prelude #3\n43:03 Girl Crazy (Selections)\n48:53 They Can't Take That Away From Me\n51:53 Rhapsody In Blue\n\nPerformers:\nCuban Overture: Richard Hayman & His Symphony Orchestra\nPiano Concerto In F - Andante Con Moto, Adagio: Kathryn Selby & CSO\nPorgy & Bess: Richard Hayman & His Symphony Orchestra\n3 Preludes For Piano - Prelude #1: Leon Bates\n3 Preludes For Piano - Preludes #2: Leon Bates\n3 Preludes For Piano - Prelude #3: Leon Bates\nGirl Crazy (Selections): Slovak State Philharmonic Strings\nThey Can't Take That Away From Me: Richard Hayman & His Symphony Orchestra\nRhapsody In Blue: Richard Hayman & His Symphony Orchestra",

        "description": "And here\u2019s the biggest one of them all. The weird, titanic, gnarled, joyous, grief-stricken monster that is the Hammerklavier. Where exactly to begin? \n\nWith the interval of a 3rd, I guess. It permeates the work at every level, creating close coordination between motivic/harmonic detail, and tonal structure. The main theme of each movement is built from the same motif: a rising and then falling 3rd. In the final movement the 3rd both defies the movement in the bass in the introduction, as well as the shape of the fugue theme: a rising 3rd (10th), following by a scalar figure that is repeated, each time descending by a 3rd. Harmonically, the development section of the third movement is built on a sequence of 3rds, and the trio of the scherzo oscillates between Bb Minor and Db Major, two keys separated by a 3rd.\n\nAt an even deeper structural level, the 3rd is all-pervasive. You\u2019d expect, in a Bb Maj sonata, that the dominant key of F would play a major role, but in 40+ minutes of music there is not a single modulation to that key. Instead, Beethoven constructs an intricate system of four keys around Bb, and returns to them time and time again. Three of them, G, D, and F#, are all separated from Bb by the interval of a third. The final, the \u201cblack key\u201d of B Minor, occurs in every movement and functions as an anti-thesis to Bb Major. The struggle between these two keys dramatically frames the entire sonata (just listen to the scherzo\u2019s ending).\n\nThere\u2019s lots more to the Hammerklavier than the 3rd. You\u2019ve got structural innovations: in the 1st movement\u2019s recapitulation the return to the stable tonic is heavily delayed (by, yes, the key of B minor), and in the 2nd the development is too short, but the recapitulation varies and decorates the theme so extensively that it becomes a sort of extended development. And you\u2019ve got the sheer contrapuntal and dramatic genius of the last movement, where a huge number of traditional contrapuntal devices are wielded with a jaggedness and fury that belies their conservative associations. It's also worth noting how contrapuntal the writing in the 1st movement is -- one of the most striking features of Beethoven's late work.\n\nMVT 1\nEXPOSITION\n00:00 \u2013 Theme 1 \n00:43 \u2013 Shift to D (modulating by 3rd), beginning of Theme group 2.\n01:51 \u2013 Theme 2 (G Maj; modulating by 3rd)\nDEVELOPMENT\n04:44 \u2013 Theme 2\n04:58 \u2013 Theme 1 head\n05:06 \u2013 Fughetta based on Theme 1 head\n06:09 \u2013 Shift from D to B Maj (modulation by 3rd; note closeness to \u201cblack key\u201d)\nRECAPITULATION\n06:37 \u2013 Theme 1\n06:48 \u2013 Shift to Gb/F#. Harmonic instability follows, and we move eventually to\n07:29 \u2013 Bm (and then G, another modulation by a 3rd, and then back at 7:51 to Bb)\n08:49 \u2013 Theme 2\n09:19 \u2013 CODA; Theme 2\n09:39 \u2013 Theme 1 head\n09:50 \u2013 Theme 1\n\nMVT 3\nEXPOSITION\n12:44 \u2013 Main Theme\n15:14 \u2013 Transition\n16:43 \u2013 Theme Group 2, Theme 1\n17:25 \u2013 Theme Group 2, Theme 2\n18:25 \u2013 Theme Group 2, Theme 3\n19:27 \u2013 DEVELOPMENT\n20:17 \u2013 RECAPITULATION [extended development]\n\nMVT 4:\nPART I\n29:52 \u2013 Introduction. Note movement by 3rds in bass, interspersed with episodes of original material.\nPART II\n32:37 \u2013 Introduction and development of fugue theme [Theme 1] and countersubject. Note how long the theme is, containing a leap and trill in the head (ordinarily a concluding device), scalar descent in 3rds in the middle, and a long chromatic tail with much implied dissonance.\nPART III\n34:07 \u2013 Introduction and brief development of new theme [Theme 2] in Gb\n34:21 \u2013 Augmentation [doubled note value] of fugue theme, with countersubject (note the constant descent by 3rds)\n34:49 \u2013 Stretto [overlapping entry] of the fugue theme\u2019s head [leap + trill]\nPART IV\n34:57 \u2013 Return to Theme 2, in Ab\n35:34 \u2013 Theme 1 in retrograde [backwards]\n36:10 \u2013 Stretti of Theme 1, initially in inversion, then including original (Note key of B)\n36:46 \u2013 Entire subject in mirrored form\n37:20 \u2013 Increasing focus on Theme 1\u2019s head, leading to trill-laden passage at 37:30\nPART V\n37:41 \u2013 Chorale (Theme 3)\nPART VI\n38:23 \u2013 Theme 3 functions as cantus firmus, and is combined with the first half of Theme 1\n38:44 \u2013 Stretto of Theme 1 (inversion + original). The music appears to be reaching a conclusion, as we\u2019re in the right key, the dominant is playing a bigger role (from 39:12 it recurs as a pedal point in the bass), and stretti/pedal points seem to militate for a conclusion.\n39:32 \u2013 But nope. Just as we reach the point where the concluding bars should be, Beethoven begins the fugue anew.\n39:47 \u2013 Exploration of subject, countersubject, and their inversions (in stretto)\n40:13 \u2013 Abruptly, the music cadences, and on the wrong [weak] beat too.\nPART VII\n40:15 \u2013 The fugue subject briefly enters, before a trill begins in the bass at 40:18 \n40:26 \u2013 As the trill continues, the RH toys with the fugue subject and countersubject. Eventually a F pedal emerges.\n40:38 \u2013 Theme 1\u2019s head is repeated, then its middle.\n40:58 \u2013 The leap and trill which opened the fugue subject closes the sonata.",
