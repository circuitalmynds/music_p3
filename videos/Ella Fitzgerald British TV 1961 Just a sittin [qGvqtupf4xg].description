To assist newstart 2009 in his huge task to bring Ella's work to the public I have reposted this clip originally posted by chico75pi. In 1961 Ella, along with Oscar Peterson and the Johnny Dankworth orchestra, performed in this TV show for UK ITV. Several clips have come to light. This one is Just a sittin and a rockin. More to come.
